*What is Breadcrumb?* Breadcrumb is a community-driven application in which users create posts of meaningful content ("crumbs"), associate them with a point in space, and then link them together in a trail. A person walking the trail will receive directional instruction to the next crumb, but will only see the full post upon arriving at the set location. Simply, *our users create digital content that can becomes accessible through real world exploration.*
